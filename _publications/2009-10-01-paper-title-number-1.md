excerpt: 'In this paper, we show that bypass and subcritical orderly transition can be simulated using the computationally efficient wall-modeled LES
method. We use Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to distinguish Turbulent-Non-Turbulent (T-NT) regions of the flow and selectively apply wall-modeling on in 
turbulent regions of the flow. We were able to show that this method is successfully able to capture the right trends of the friction Reynolds number 
similar to a DNS at much less computational cost.'
