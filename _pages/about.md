Hi, this is Ghanesh Narasimhan. Welcome to my webpage. I am a PhD candidate in the Mechanical Engineering department at Johns Hopkins University.
I am co-advised by Prof. Dennice Gayme and Prof. Charles Meneveau. My broad area of research interest is fluid mechanics. I like solving problems 
in fluid dynamics applied to engineering and geophysics using either analytical, numerical or experimental methods that better suits a given problem.

I am from Ranipet, Tamil Nadu, India. I grew up in Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) township with my mother, father and a younger brother. I did 
schooling till 10th grade in DAV BHEL school. I then moved to study my 11th and 12th grade in Maharishi Vidya Mandir school in Chennai.
I have always been interested in studying physics and mathematics. Therefore, I had a natural liking towards Mechanical Engineering. Hence, I pursued my 
undergrad in this subject at National Institute of Technology, Trichy (NIT-T). During my undergrad, I had a fervor for engineering design and fluid 
mechanics. I was part of NIT-T's student racing team called PSI racing where I learnt a lot on engineering design and manufacturing. Being part of this 
team, we built 3 racing cars to compete in national level student racing competitions. 

To satisfy my interest in fluid mechanics, I joined as a summer research student in the Engineering Mechanics Unit (EMU) at Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for 
Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR). I worked with Prof. K. R. Sreenivas and performed experiments on a rotating set-up that simulates the outer-core 
convection. The research environment at JNCASR further bolstered my interest in fluid mechanics. Hence, I then joined the Centre for Earth Sciences (CEaS), 
Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore for my Masters (by research) degree. Here, I worked with Prof. Binod Sreenivasan on low-Rm theoretical 
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence. I also built a rotating convection set-up along with a fellow PhD colleague in CEaS, IISc. The set-up was built to study the fluid dynamics of outer-core convection. 

After my masters, I transitioned towards studying turbulence, Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) and wind energy. I joined as a PhD student with Prof. Tamer 
Zaki and Prof. Charles Meneveau. I worked on applying wall-modelled LES to simulate bypass and orderly transition in a channel flow. After completing 
this project, I started working with Prof. Dennice Gayme and Prof. Charles Meneveau on wind energy which is my current area of research. Here, I am working
on understanding the fluid dynamics of a yawed wind turbine wake in the presence of an Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL).

This is a brief account of my journey till now. Please visit other links to know more about my projects in detail. I am excited to keep continuing this 
journey by solving more interesting fluid dynamical problems in the future. 

Note:- This webpage is work in progress. So, please bear with me patiently till I add other contents.
