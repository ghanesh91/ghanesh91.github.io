excerpt: 'In this work, we study decay properties of a Gaussian eddy in the presence of background magnetic field and rotation in the low-magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) limit. In the absence of rotation, the eddy would evolve as an Alfven wave whose decay properties were studied in detail in Moffatt (1967). When rotation is added, the perturbation propagates as a Magneto-Coriolis (MC) wave. The corresponding decay laws for its kinetic and magnetic energies are obtained, and implications for the Earth's core is discussed in this paper.'
