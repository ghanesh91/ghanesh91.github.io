Hi, this is Ghanesh Narasimhan. Welcome to my webpage. I am a PhD candidate in the Mechanical Engineering department at Johns Hopkins University.
I am co-advised by Prof. Dennice Gayme and Prof. Charles Meneveau. My broad research area of interest is fluid mechanics. I like solving problems 
in fluid dynamics applied to engineering and geophysics using either analytical, numerical or experimental methods that better suits a given problem.

I am from Ranipet, Tamil Nadu, India. I grew up in BHEL (Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd.) township with my mother, father and a younger brother. I did 
schooling till 10th grade in DAV BHEL school within the township. I then moved to study my 11th and 12th grade in Maharishi Vidya Mandir school in Chennai.
I was always interested in studying physics and mathematics. Therefore, I had a natural liking towards Mechanical Engineering. Hence, I pursued my 
undergrad in this subject at National Institute of Technology, Trichy (NIT-T). During my undergrad, I had a fervor for engineering design and fluid 
mechanics. I was part of NIT-T's student racing team called PSI racing where I learnt a lot on engineering design and manufacturing. Being part of this 
team, we built 3 racing cars to compete in national level student racing competitions. 

To satisfy my interest in fluid mechanics, I joined as a summer research student in the Emgineering Mechanics Unit (EMU) at Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for 
Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR). I worked with Prof. K. R. Sreenivas and performed experiments on a rotating set-up that simulates the outer-core 
convection. The research environment at JNCASR further bolstered my interest in fluid mechanics. Hence, I then joined Centre for Earth Sciences (CEaS), 
Indian institute of Science, Bangalore for my Masters degree. Here, I worked with Prof. Binod Sreenivasan on theoretical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) 
turbulence. I also built a rotating convection set-up along with my fellow colleague in CEaS, IISc. The set-up was built aimed at studying the fluid dynamics of outer-core convection. 

After my masters, I transitioned towards studying turbulence, Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) and wind energy. I joined as a PhD student with Prof. Tamer Zaki 
and Prof. Charles Meneveau during the beginning of my PhD. I worked on applying wall-modeled LES to simulate bypass and orderly transition in a channel 
flow. After completing this project, I started working with Prof. Dennice Gayme and Prof. Charles Meneveau on fluid mechanics applied wind energy which is 
my current area of work.

This is a brief account of my journey till now. Please visit other links to know more of my projects in detail. I am excited to keep continuing this journey by solving more interesting fluid dynamical problems in the future.
