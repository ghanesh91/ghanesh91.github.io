excerpt: 'In this paper, we show that bypass and subcritical orderly transition can be simulated using the computationally efficient wall-modeled LES
method. We use Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to distinguish Turbulent-Non-Turbulent (T-NT) regions of the flow and selectively apply wall-modeling only in 
turbulent regions of the flow. We were able to show that this method successfully captures the right trends in the evolution of friction Reynolds number 
(skin-friction) similar to a DNS at much less computational cost.'
