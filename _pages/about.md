Hi, this is Ghanesh Narasimhan. I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

I am interested in fluid dynamics research applied to solving problems in engineering and geophysics. I work in the areas of modeling atmospheric turbulence for wind energy applications, Large Eddy Simulations, transition to turbulence and magnetohydrodynamics applied to Earth Sciences research.
