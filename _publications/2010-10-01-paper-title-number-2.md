excerpt: 'In this work, we study the evolution of a Gaussian eddy perturbation in the presence of a background magnetic field and rotation. We consider a low magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) limit applicable to small-scale flows in Earth's outer core and liquid metal flows in a laboratory. The perturbation evolves as an Alfven wave in the presence of only a background magnetic field whose decay properties were already studied in Moffat (1967). In this work, we add rotation to the problem and now the perturbation would evolve as a Magneto-Coriolis (MC) wave. We then obtain analytical estimates of the decay laws for kinetic and magnetic energis of the MC wave perturbation.'
