excerpt: 'Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is used to study the wind veer effects on the wake of a yawed wind turbine. The veer deflects the wake in the spanwise direction, and this effect can be captured in the wake model by adding a veer correction term. The counter-rotating vortex pair structures previously observed behind yawed turbines can also be recovered by subtracting the background veer vorticity.'
